# Catting absolute paths
We can cat files by giving their absolute paths as arguments too.
	So unlike the previous challenge, this time we are supposed to read the flag file by giving its
absolute path, where the path is technically in pwn.college itself, but we can't access it directly from
home directory.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{0E7PrfxsLXRtQyUl8hbs1bEGG_y.dlTM5QDL2kTN0czW}
```
