#Program and Absolute Paths
	In this challenge, our challenge is present in the challenge directory. The program I need to
invoke was run. So, I gave absolute path to the program `/challenge/run`. This earned me the flag.

```bash
giridhar@LAPTOP-EQ112OJM:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8XVQyaesBAjktrhblE-bqFlE0N3.dVDN1QDL2kTN0czW
```
