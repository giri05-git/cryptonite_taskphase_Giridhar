# Reading Input
When we know the value eariler, we can use the *=* operator to assign the value. But if we don't know the value before, we can give input to a value that is to be stored in a variable. This is done using the command `read`.Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{8Ut0L9m4sF58zEHmE8cYbHYaawa.dhzN1QDL2kTN0czW}
	In this challenge, we are asked to get an input for the variable `PWN`. And then the input should be given as `COLLEGE`. Doing this gave me the flag.
