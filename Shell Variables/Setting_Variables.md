# Setting Variables
Like we read value from variable, in this challenge, we are asked to assign a value to an existing variable. For assigning values, we use the assigning 
operator `=` . Also, we shouldn't make spaces around this operator because then the variable will be considered a command. 
	In this challenge, I was asked to set the value *COLLEGE* to the variable *PWN*. So in order to do that, I gave **PWN=COLLEGE**.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{AX1erOTOyKTAgoXb_HzliXqggR7.dlTN1QDL2kTN0czW}
```
