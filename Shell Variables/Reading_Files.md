# Reading Files
Sometimes, when to get a value from user, and give it to a variable, we might need to give multiline codes to do the required process. But, this is what is usually known as *Useless Use of Cat*.
	In this challenge, I need to read from the file `/challenge/read_me* and redirect it as an input into the variable *PWN*. So in order to do this without much waste of time or running extra programs, I have given the code as shown below in order to get the flag.

```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4PzpcfEboCli-C95dTG2Vcgsjku.dBjM4QDL2kTN0czW}
```
