# Multi-word Variables
While setting a value to variable, we can do multi word values also. But, while doing this, the value should be given in double quotes*("")*. Otherwise,
the text after the space would be considered an argument and the one on the left side will be taken as the command leading to an error or unwanted output.
	In this challenge, I was asked to add the text *COLLEGE YEAH* to the variable *VAR*. So in order to do that, I used the double quotes and gave as follows: ```VAR="COLLEGE YEAH"```
```bash
Connected!
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4ZSGscVhwgm6HwDGaSa21IJdBqK.dBjN1QDL2kTN0czW}
```
