# Printing Variables
In this challenge, we are asked to print the flag which is stored in a variable *FLAG* . So, in order to acces the contents, we use *$* along with the name of the variable. And in order to print the contents out, I used the command *echo* . 
```bash
giridhar@LAPTOP-EQ112OJM:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{01pesKYfQmWC46VKAMUetD1Dukk.ddTN1QDL2kTN0czW}
```
