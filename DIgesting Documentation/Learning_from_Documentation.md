# Learning From Documentation
Documentation is important because it gives information about set of materials present in a program. In
simple terms, documentation is basically just figuring out how to use the programs, and figuring out what arguments to specify on the command line. We can use a program correctly if we have provided proper
specification of arguments to them.
	In this challenge, I was asked to invoke a program `/challenge/challenge`. But since this is basically documentation challenge, we are asked to give an argument `--giveflag` to this program to get the flag.

```bash
giridhar@LAPTOP-EQ112OJM:~$ ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4FkgIOaOoacGXpmQLLUGj4DrgKG.dRjM5QDL2kTN0czW}
```
