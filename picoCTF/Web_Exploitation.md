# cookies
Cookie take memory of our system and store data in browser, which means we have control over it and alter with the data of cookies. With this knowledge in hand, I went through the challenge.

In the challenge description page, all that was given was link to a site. On going there, it was a cookie page with an option to enter different cookie names.

They have given an example *snicker doodle* so I entered that. It showed that it was not special enough. So I understood that basically what I wanted to do was cookie manipulation, i.e, change the cookie value after going to developer console of chrome.

On reaching there, my next task was to identify how many different cookie values was available. So I tried with range values and realized that cookie values were ranging from 0 to 29. Then, I tried different values for cookie and each time I got different cookie names until I tried giving 18 and got the flag.

`FLAG:picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`

**Difficulties Faced:** I was confused with which value to give and tried to just  give random value without an order which caused me to take time.

 # Forbidden Paths
This challenge provided a website link and also said to us the file path for the files in the website as well as gave us the file path of the flag file which we need to access.
	So, I first went to the website and had a look at it.

So we know all the files in that website are in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory and what I needed to access was flag file in home directory. So in order to give in form of relative path, I needed to move back directories using `../` and then I read the file. 
So, in all, the relative path I provided was `../../../flag.txt` which gave me the flag.

# Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol
The hint gave me an idea that the flag data is hidden in some way. I started the challenge by downloading the file given which was a `.pcapng` file. I searched for softwares to open the  file and found out that the file itself gave it was a wireshark capture file. So I used wireshark to open the file which showed me that it was multiple packet files in it.

<img width="1279" alt="tftpwireshark" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/783d378d-fe2d-46f5-a2c3-c6e58ba2a29a" />

So I tried to extract the files with tftp extension so I get only the required items I need.

So, on extracting, I received the following files.

On opening the instructions txt file, I saw `GSGCQBRFAGRAPELCGBHEGENSSVPFBJRZHFGQVFTHVFRBHESYNTGENAFSRE.SVTHERBHGNJNLGBUVQRGURSYNTNAQVJVYYPURPXONPXSBEGURCYNA` and opening plan txt file, I saw `VHFRQGURCEBTENZNAQUVQVGJVGU-QHRQVYVTRAPR.PURPXBHGGURCUBGBF`. I tried to decipher it using rot13 website which gave me
`TFTPDOESNTENCRYPTOURTRAFFICSOWEMUSTDISGUISEOURFLAGTRANSFER.FIGUREOUTAWAYTOHIDETHEFLAGANDIWILLCHECKBACKFORTHEPLAN` for instructions file and `IUSEDTHEPROGRAMANDHIDITWITH-DUEDILIGENCE.CHECKOUTTHEPHOTOS` for plan file.

It also contained a Debian file which ran in wsl showed me an app `steghide` in it. Steghide is a stegnography hiding tool, so inorder to access it, we needed a key. On looking at the deciphered text, I assumed the key to be `DUEDILIGENCE` and tried it out.

```
giridhar@LAPTOP-EQ112OJM:/mnt/c/Users/sreek/Downloads/tftp$ steghide extract -sf picture1.bmp
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!
giridhar@LAPTOP-EQ112OJM:/mnt/c/Users/sreek/Downloads/tftp$ steghide extract -sf picture2.bmp
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!
giridhar@LAPTOP-EQ112OJM:/mnt/c/Users/sreek/Downloads/tftp$ steghide extract -sf picture3.bmp
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".
```
On opening the `flag` file, I got the file.

`FLAG:picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}`
