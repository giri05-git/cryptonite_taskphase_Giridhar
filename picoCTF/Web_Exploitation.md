Cookie take memory of our system and store data in browser, which means we have control over it and alter with the data of cookies. With this knowledge in hand, I went through the challenge.

In the challenge description page, all that was given was link to a site. On going there, it was a cookie page with an option to enter different cookie names.

They have given an example *snicker doodle* so I entered that. It showed that it was not special enough. So I understood that basically what I wanted to do was cookie manipulation, i.e, change the cookie value after going to developer console of chrome.

On reaching there, my next task was to identify how many different cookie values was available. So I tried with range values and realized that cookie values were ranging from 0 to 29. Then, I tried different values for cookie and each time I got different cookie names until I tried giving 18 and got the flag.

`FLAG:picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`

**Difficulties Faced:** I was confused with which value to give and tried to just  give random value without an order which caused me to take time.
