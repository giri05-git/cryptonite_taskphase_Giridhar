# cookies
Cookie take memory of our system and store data in browser, which means we have control over it and alter with the data of cookies. With this knowledge in hand, I went through the challenge.

In the challenge description page, all that was given was link to a site. On going there, it was a cookie page with an option to enter different cookie names.

They have given an example *snicker doodle* so I entered that. It showed that it was not special enough. So I understood that basically what I wanted to do was cookie manipulation, i.e, change the cookie value after going to developer console of chrome.

On reaching there, my next task was to identify how many different cookie values was available. So I tried with range values and realized that cookie values were ranging from 0 to 29. Then, I tried different values for cookie and each time I got different cookie names until I tried giving 18 and got the flag.

`FLAG:picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_a1f5bdb7}`

**Difficulties Faced:** I was confused with which value to give and tried to just  give random value without an order which caused me to take time.

 # Forbidden Paths
This challenge provided a website link and also said to us the file path for the files in the website as well as gave us the file path of the flag file which we need to access.
	So, I first went to the website and had a look at it.

So we know all the files in that website are in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` directory and what I needed to access was flag file in home directory. So in order to give in form of relative path, I needed to move back directories using `../` and then I read the file. 
So, in all, the relative path I provided was `../../../flag.txt` which gave me the flag.

# SOAP
There wasn't much description for the challenege, only a web portal was provided. On opening the website, there was three suboptions which opened gave some data on the bottom of the page.

I searched to for websites to analyze the requests given by the website which can be used as a website vulnerability and exploited to get the flag. So for this, I installed burpsite.

Some files could be hidden in the website. When the hint said XML Entity injection, I searched what is from a website and found that it is a vulnerability that can help us interfere with the website's data which means we can access the hidden file by sending a request to the website.

Next, we needed to find an appropriate command(called payload here) to send for the hidden file. I visited a GitHub writeup to find the appropriate command and it gave me one.
`<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>`

On using this command for the password file which is given in the description, I got the flag.
