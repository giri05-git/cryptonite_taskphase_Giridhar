# Permission Tweaking Practices
In this challenge, I needed to change the access accordingly as they asked for 8 times to get my flag. Anytime I made a mistake, I ended at the start. So nothing much, just made sure I gave the access carefully as pinpointed and they ask and I got the flag.

```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
