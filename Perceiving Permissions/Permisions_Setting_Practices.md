# Permissions Setting Practice
So till now, we have gave permissions using *+* or *-* . But the thing, we can be more precise. Just set permissions for each accessors individually and separate their permissions using a *comma(,)*.
	In this challenge, I did the same 8 rounds of giving accesses like last challenge, but unlike last one, this time using the new learnt `=` operator. I did that accurately without making mistake and got the flag

```bash

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
