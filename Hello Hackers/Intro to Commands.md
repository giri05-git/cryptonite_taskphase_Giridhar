# Intro to Commands
In this challenge, we are introduced to commands in the terminal. `Commands` are programs or utilities that run in terminal. `whoami` and `hello` are examples of commands. We start the 
challenge by connecting our terminal to pwn.college. Then we ask the terminal for the username by using the command `whoami` to which the terminal returns the username i.e, *giri05-git*
in my case. Similarly, we give the command `hello` not `Hello` or `HELLO` or any other case specifics because the terminal is case specific. As soon as you enter hello command, the challenge is
completed and the flag is earned.
```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MJ8zLhK43QBoqDrwzY59wnySFjl.ddjNyUDL2kTN0czW}
```
