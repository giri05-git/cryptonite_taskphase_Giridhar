Since this was a reverse engineering challenge, I opened up the file in IDA and searched for the file in the gamefiles given.

But what the writeup said was to modify the gamefiles given in it, some of which them restricts us from getting the flag.

In the game files, missile and terraingenerator classes prevent us from getting the flag, so we need to modify these in such a way we nullify their operatiosn and get the flag.
